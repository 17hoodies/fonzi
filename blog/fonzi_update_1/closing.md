If you have made it this far, thank you for reading. If this may look like I did not say much, I shared whatever feels comfortable with me to have out in public. And I hope this will help answer your questions you may have about me or any wonders you have been thinking of. I would like to say thank you all for reading this, and I hope everything goes well for you, no matter the position you are in. I would like to thank my family and friends for sticking along with my journey and personal improvement. I really could not be here without you all, and I give my uttermost thanks for that. I will keep pushing myself to stay motivated to do the things I love doing and better myself to shape a better me.  

This all in all sounds like I’m taking a hiatus (sort of) and yes it is. I will announce it when the time is right, given all the situations listed above.
