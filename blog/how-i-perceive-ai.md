This is from the r/NeuroSama subreddit  
I will say that as much as I like watching Neuro, I will treat the same for other creators who use AI for a passion like creating entertainment, not for replacing the talent of others.  
As I'm studying computers, I am learning the use of AI and how it works through models. As I learn more every day about it, I have a good understanding on what it's useful and not (in a way where it replaces the existing job of a human can do)  
AI has come in a long way, and what we can do is to learn how to use it without replacing the jobs of others (basically use it for stuff that is a learning tool instead of cheating)
