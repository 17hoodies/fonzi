# <center>Social Anxiety &#128156;</center>  
I have had social anxiety my entire life. I mean as a kid, it was like I was always called shy; and now I am an adult, you are expected to just "grow out of it."

Granted I found out I was autistic later in life so that plays a huge part of it, but I know autistic people that do not get socially anxious. I think the big reason for me being socially anxious all the time is from me being bullied as a child for being autistic and not fitting in socially. Because the anxiety and fear come from judgement from others and my fear of judgement is the fear that the bullying will happen again. Even though it is not logical to think this way I still do. That is why generic advice usually does not work. What I needed was someone who will support me and slowly gain confidence socially. 

Remember people: Progress is not linear. Do not be disheartened if you are trying to improve socially and things do not go well. And even if you are not in the headspace to even try to improve, that is also okay. I have been there. People often assume if someone has social anxiety, they are trying to improve it 24/7. But starting to try is the hardest part because oftentimes we do not believe that we can. 

But I believe in you, and so in myself.
So keep going and make the world proud.
