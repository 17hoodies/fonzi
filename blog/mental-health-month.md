# <center> Mental Health Awareness Month </center>

May 1st marks the start of Mental Health Awareness Month.
No big speeches, just a quiet reminder:

You're not alone. Life gets loud, messy, or overwhelming. Sometimes it feels like you're standing still while the world keeps moving. But even stillness is a part of the process. Progress doesn't always announce itself. Sometimes it's just breathing through the hard moments.

You survived 100% of your worst days so far. Let that mean something.
Take care of yourself.
Check on your people.

No one's got it all figured out. We're all just trying,
and that's enough.
