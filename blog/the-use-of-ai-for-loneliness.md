# <center> The use of AI for loneliness </center>  

I saw a video the other day where it's an advertisement of an AI application that you can talk to avatars. The way it told the viewer was to lure them into a escape route from the world, but the other person isn't real.  
**That terrifies me.** Replacing genuine human connection with AI just to seek companionship is so dystopian. It doesn't treat depression, it only feeds it. It's an echo chamber.  

Its sole purpose is to provide comfort in the form of temporary respite. It makes you come back for more because that's what it is made for. Its sole purpose is to delude. To make you stray further from reality and become dependent on its false hope. Its existence serves to satiate one's desire for mere self indulgence.  

I am not afraid of AI for its capabilities and constant growth, I fear our misuse of it.
