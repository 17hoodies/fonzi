Now let us get into the family.  
My family has seen some changes that are upcoming in the future, which I will talk about here. Before I get into that, I want to say that my family is doing well. Although a lot has happened, everything is going all right with my family. As for what happened with the family, there are two key events upcoming.  

1. **My brother is getting married**  
He is officially planning his wedding with his high school sweetheart for May 2026. This is huge for my family and me as it is the first sibling in the family to ever reach this far in life successfully (not yet). I feel proud of how my brother has gotten this far and is months away from changing his life. After the marriage, he promised he would be moving out of my parents’ crib so I could have his room. This will be a life-changing moment for me and my family as I cannot wait for what is next for my brother to achieve. This will be a brother’s moment.  

2. **My sister is pregnant**  
That means I am going to be an uncle now. This was kind of something that came unexpectedly to me and my family, but me and the others are proud of how far she has come as well. Once this happens, I will have to adapt to what is best for my family. This has also caused her to plan to move out of the house very soon in the upcoming days. I do not know if she will take her cat with her, but if she does not, I will take diligent care of it. When this got to my mom, it got bumpy with mixed reactions. But at the point it was getting serious like now, she is happy about it. I am glad for my sister and what she is going to do in the future, like my brother.  

With those two coming into mind, I cannot really tell what next year brings me and my family. I mean I am hoping everything goes well with what my siblings want to do. But it just sounds like moving out is going to affect my parents, especially my mom who has been the person who raises my siblings since day one. My dad? Probably not as much as my mom but just taking care of their cats as obviously they are both indoor cats.  

Speaking about my parents, my parents are getting old. Seeing my parents getting older scares me. Because. Well, what would I ever do without them? I know I sound like I am dependent, but I am a kid at heart. I love my parents to death and seeing them now in their fifties, it scares me for how long they are going to be here for longer. I know I should not be thinking of this, but I recently had this come across to me after my mom's birthday in September.  

But yes, I love how far my family has come to where my siblings are doing their best at doing what they want to do next for their life.
