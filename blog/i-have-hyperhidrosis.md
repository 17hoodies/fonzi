# <center> I have Hyperhidrosis </center>  

New diagnosis: Hyperhidrosis

Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by excessive sweating. This sweating goes beyond what's considered normal for regulating body temperature.
It can be triggered by stress (what I struggle with) and when studying as well.

I was told by my professional that:
1. I should find a more effective study technique. It seems as though my body is going through unnecessary stress when trying to study content. It doesn’t have to be that way. I imagine that subliminally, my brain is not content with my study technique and I should find alternate ways to retain information.

2. I should talk to a doctor about this. It isn’t always caused by stress. But if it is, I could also be prescribed anti-anxiety medication that can be very helpful for my mental state while I'm in a clearly stressful academic program.
