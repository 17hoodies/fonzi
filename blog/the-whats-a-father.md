This pisses me off. People saying "grown ass man" and shit like that. No he wasn't a grown ass man lmao. Legally adult at the time, but as someone with full depth and maturity though? No. He was a kid bro. Just like everybody else. What egotistical teen that's pissed at their dad for not being around isn't gonna say this. That's another thing that is so frustrating because like anything he said... childhood trauma? The media is dumb. They still got the right name in the mouth at least. They are still gagging on XXXTENTATION years later even if it's disrespectful, it's all a part of it.
