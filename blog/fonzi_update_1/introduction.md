### A document version is [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3_EdL1VGKYcETvROqyiCNNjPHRJ48e8WxD787TBR3I/edit?usp=sharing)

To whom this comes across, hi.  

I know it has been a while since I came across giving my updates on myself, but it has been due long enough that I will make this one a paper format as thereâ€™s kind of a lot to go over. What has happened in the last few months has taken a toll on me mainly because of:  

1. School (In 2nd year of college)
2. Family (A lot has happened, especially to my loved ones)
3. Myself (Keeping up with my health and mental state)  

This document will be split into three different sections, covering all what is listed above. And this is planned to be published on October 9, 2025, at 8:00PM PST. After it is published, I will be open to feedback and questions you may have. And if you made it this far already, thank you for that. I appreciate everyone whom I know and people who are reading this. Now going on, let us go over with the first topic.
