# <center> Is Anxiety Hard? </center>  

Anxiety is hard, even when you feel like you’ve mastered it. 

Because what anxiety really is, is this little voice of worry. It makes you want to harp on things from the past that you can’t change but wish you could. It makes you hyper fixate on something that is to come or can come and you want to be best prepared for how to react to it. 

Anxiety is this little voice of worry that wants to do everything to remove you from this present moment and make you think about the past or future too often and too much. And when those thoughts begin to overwhelm you, when that spiral begins and you feel it in every inch of you...focus on where you are right now. 

Focus on the problem when and if it even becomes that. Focus on who you are right now. That little voice of worry is just the part of you that cares so much. That’s who you are, someone who cares so much. 

Caring the way you do is your superpower. But with every superpower there is also kryptonite. Sometimes we can be our kryptonite. So, when that little voice of worry tries to take over, remember so many of the problems are ones we create in our own minds that don’t even come to fruition.
