Those 2 words. 

It reminds me much of my grandfather, who's up in heaven with God. I didn't have much time with him since he's from another country, but I wish I did as much as my mother. I never got to really see who he is as a wonderful guy my mother described it, until I last saw him in person 3 years ago when I visited his country and was in the hospital. I really miss him, and I really wanted to know him better. 

A thing or 2 that describes who I am as a person is that I hold close what I love. Because at the end of the day, it's all about caring. 

May God protect him, me, and my loved ones, always. 
Fly high.
