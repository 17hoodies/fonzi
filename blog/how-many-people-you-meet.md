# <center> How many people you meet in life? </center>  

On average, you’ll meet around 80,000 people in your lifetime, but only about 500 to 1,500 will be part of your larger social network. Even crazier, you’ll form deep, meaningful connections with just 5 to 15 people.  

A reminder to value those rare bonds with those you love.
