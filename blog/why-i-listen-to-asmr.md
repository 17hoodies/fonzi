# <center> Why I listen to ASMR </center>  

I've had a relatively easy life but I am realizing in the last few months that because I had such an easy and privileged upbringing, my parents guilted me for being sad. I don't think they did this on purpose. But nonetheless, I didn't get a lot of emotional validation as a kid.

No wonder I love stuff like this so much for 2 years now.
