# <center> My interpretation on The True Ending in KinitoPET </center>  

There is something so tragic about how he does not stop calling you friend even after he is remorseful, even after he is aware he is hurt you enough to apologize, even after you killed him in return. His programming is rigid, he has the unfinished business of a ghost and the inability to think freely of a computer program. So, his obsession, wanting to be your friend, wanting to be friends with as many people as possible, is just unfixable. Or so it seems. But to the absolute best of his ability, he is still trying to reclaim his last moments as proof he did care, beyond his obsession. He is trying to show he can get just a bit better, even if it is inside of the horribly rigid box, he is in, mentally. Even if it is his last moments, even if there is nothing he could do differently now. I think that little smile at the end is meant to show some self-awareness. 

It is meant to show that he, on some level, is glad he does not have to chase his obsession anymore. Even if it is only because he was forced to never do it again. He is glad you are free from him. (Even if, by some interpretations, including my own, you are dying with him since you are trapped in the computer) That's why the ending is so peaceful. He has finally been given peace from his own obsession. 

Thematically, this game is about change. That we should be glad that we can change as humans, that we can have that peace without having to die for it. (Even those with specific issues that make it harder, like OCD) And that, sometimes, change is still going to hurt, change is still going to feel wrong or like a downgrade, and "letting go" of the things we cling to is not a one-and-done thing. But instead, a gradual, non-linear process where we sometimes regress a bit. Where what is best for you seems like it is only visible through an uncertain fog, and what is comfortable (yet harmful) is right here, like home. It is being brave and stepping into that fog that is the hard part, and it is just as hard not to simply walk back. Inevitably, a lot of us do end up coming back. 

But doing something different when you have the chance? Showing just a minor change? Showing a smile? It means a lot. It is like walking back into that fog. The fog that will always be there for another try, so long as you are alive. And this was Kinito using his last moments to step into that fog. Even if he stumbled, even if it was only because of circumstance, which means a lot. That is my interpretation anyway.
