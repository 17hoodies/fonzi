# <center> My High School Graduation </center>  

...What can I say man.

It feels like 4 years ago was yesterday and today is when I step into a new chapter of my life. To all my friends and peers that has been by my side this whole entire time, thank you for the joy and support you guys have brought to me for brightening up my days. And to my family, thank you for giving me the world to explore and become who I want to be. I wish my grandpa was here to experience it, but he's currently in a safe place with God himself. If I had to say something for the people that are on the verge of getting far into their young days, don't be afraid to be who you want to become. You can become the best version of yourself if you put the mind into what you want to put the mind into. Life is based off decisions. It's not about what you dealt; it's about how you deal with it. In every situation, you must keep your eyes and mind open at any given time. Don't let anyone get to you, your decisions are what pave your destiny. It's about making the right decisions and how you deal with it, that's all that matters. 

The other day I felt so lost. Who brought me back? Me. I think I'm the only person who can bring myself back like you can have everyone surrounded with you. You got to take that love that's offered and say "you know what, life is pretty kickass". 

Thank you to God for giving me a life to live at it's fullest with pride and blessings for me always by my side, my family who's been supporting since day 1, and my friends & others who have helped me down the road. I couldn't really have done it without you guys. I'll see y'all at the next chapter!
