# <center> Advice on Managers </center>  

If you have a manager, you know the insides and outsides of EVERYTHING going on/being said, etc.

You and your manager are not two separate people when it’s convenient and one team when it benefits you. Using them as a mouthpiece to spin things or plead ignorance doesn’t make you look smart; It makes you look spineless. You can’t play the “I didn’t know what was happening” card when the decisions being made are about your brand, your actions, and your reputation. If your manager mistreats people on your behalf, that blood is on your hands, not just theirs. Accountability doesn’t get delegated. You don’t get to enjoy all the perks of having a team and then ditch the responsibility when it’s inconvenient. You are still responsible for your choices, your voice, your brand, your behavior; even when someone else is holding the mic for you if it all goes sideways.
