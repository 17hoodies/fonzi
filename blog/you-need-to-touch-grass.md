# <center> You NEED to touch grass. </center>  

Face the noise. We spend FAR too much time online, connected to this vast network of people, opportunities and resources. The internet is incredible, it is a place of unity, discourse, knowledge, and literally all of humanity, creativity, and business can be shared from anywhere in the world. But when you spend too much time online, especially if you use the internet as a crutch to avoid facing your real-world problems, it can begin to aide in a serious bout of depression, anxiety, and for some it even assists in the progression of suicidal thoughts. Being online so much can have even the brightest minds completely convinced that our world as we know it is doomed to fail, and that tragedy and horror are all around us, waiting to strike at the first opportunity. Now, while there ARE legitimate concerns and active genocides, and terrible horrors taking place in the world; our actions to make these situations better can't help if we're stuck in a cycle of doom and depression. This is why you need to get offline, and reconnect with the world in a literal sense... get out into nature, I don't care if you don't like camping, hiking, rock climbing, or even anything pertaining to the wild or natural elements. Just go on a walk in a park, touch the leaves on a tree, watch how the sun beams through the leaves and makes these beautiful rays of light. try camping, take a couple friends to a campsite or find a hiking trail near you and go explore it. Reconnecting with nature has been shown to have countless health and stress related benefits, but all that aside, your spirit will literally feel a shift when you're within nature.

For the next two weeks, try to put your phone away for 1 hour a day, and go outside; rain or shine... and just appreciate aspects of nature that you have around you.
